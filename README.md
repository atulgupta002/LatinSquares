# LatinSquares
A solution to the Latin Square problem. 

In combinatorics and in experimental design, a Latin square is an n Ã— n array filled with n different symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.
Here are using arabic numerals to represent different symbols.

The algorithm uses recursion with backtracking to determine the solution. It can also be used to study Maze with obstacles problem.
